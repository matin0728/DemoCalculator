# About this project
This a demonstration project for a enhanced calculator implementation.
Demostration of following programming showcase:

- Abstraction design architecture of operator and transformer.
- Extensibility of new operator and transformer: just need to add it's defenition and modification of keyboard layout.
- The usecase of a StateMachine.
- Behavior based unit test approach.
- Different layout for variant size class.
- Typical MVC architecture for an app.
- How to use Generic types for separating protocol based behavior constraints and underlying implementation.

# TODO
I have already find a Ad-Hoc distribution service for individual developer, but before that, it need wait a while to complete the enroll application. Thus, if you want evaluate the app in real device, you need download the source code and build it on local devices, or take a quick look from the screen recording.
